This readme is going to get updated later, but a few important notes:

The project is built on top of [EmmittJ's Skilltree Typescript](https://github.com/EmmittJ/SkillTree_TypeScript/) repository. All credit goes to them for the foundation!

Future plans: 
Skilltree importing and exporting

Quick guide:
